# Manage Users

### User **Roles**&#x20;

Kerno currently has three user roles:

* **Owner**: The Owner has the highest level of access in the organization. They can manage all settings, members, and roles, as well as delete the organization entirely.
* **Admin**: Admin users have full access to manage the organization, its settings, and its members, but they cannot delete the organization.
* **Member**: Member users can access services and features but cannot modify organizational settings, manage members, or delete the organization.

### View All Members

The **Members List** displays all users in the organization along with their email addresses and roles.

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the sidebar menu.
2. Under the **Organization** menu, select **Members**.
3. You will see a list of all users in the organization, their roles, and their current status.

Use the search bar at the top to locate a specific user quickly.
