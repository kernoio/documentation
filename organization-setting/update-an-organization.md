# Update an Organization

An **Organization** in Kerno is the highest-level logical structure and is the foundation for managing all resources and activities within Kerno.

### **Editing Organization Details**

If you need to update your organization's details, such as its name or slug, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Settings** menu using the left-hand sidebar.
2. Under **Settings**, select **Organization** and then click on the **General** tab.
3. In the **Organization Details** section, update the following:
   * **Name**: Enter the new name for your organization.
   * **URL (Slug)**: Update the slug if required. This will affect the URL used to access your organization in Kerno.
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

**Important**: Updating the organization slug will change the URL, which may affect API integrations or bookmarks referencing the previous URL.
{% endhint %}
