# Explore our Sandbox

The **Kerno Sandbox** is a fully interactive environment that allows you to explore Kerno’s features **without installation**. It provides a hands-on experience with real Kubernetes observability data, so you can see how Kerno works before deploying it in your own cluster.

### **Accessing the Sandbox**

1. Go to [**app.kerno.io**](https://app.kerno.io/?origin=docssandbox).
2. Log in using the guest account credentials:
